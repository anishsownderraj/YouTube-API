# YouTube API
Created an application that manipulates data from the YouTube API to provide information not readily available to the user on the YouTube App. By inputting a YouTuber username, the application calculates the total duration of any specified playlist, names the videos in the playlist, and displays the shortest and longest video in the playlist. As a result, the user can decide which playlist will take up most of their time, and decide to watch it or not.

## Getting Started
## Requirements
* `python` 3.x
* `pip`
* [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
## Instructions
1. Clone the Repository using the URL
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/anishsownderraj/YouTube-API
```
2. Set up an virtual environment(found below)

3. Install the requirements.txt file(found below)

## Create a new virtual environment
The following command creates a new virtual environment named `venv` in the current directory, usually this will be your project's directory.
```sh
$ virtualenv venv
```

## Activate virtual environment
The following commands [activate](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/#activate-script) an existing virtual environment on Windows and Unix systems. The command assume that the virtual environment is named `venv` and that its location is in a subdirectory `path/to/` of the current directory. 
```sh
# Windows (CMD.exe)
$ path\to\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Unix
$ source path/to/venv//bin/activate
```
Once the virtual environment has been actiated your console cursor might prepend the name of the virtual environment as shown below.
```sh
$ (venv) echo 'Hello World!'
```

## Deactivate virtual environment
The following command deactivates the current virtual environment, any dependency installed after this command will be installed globally.
```sh
$ (venv) deactivate
```

## Requirements.txt
To install dependencies in the current environment from a `requirements.txt` file the command below can be used.
```sh
$ (venv) pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
